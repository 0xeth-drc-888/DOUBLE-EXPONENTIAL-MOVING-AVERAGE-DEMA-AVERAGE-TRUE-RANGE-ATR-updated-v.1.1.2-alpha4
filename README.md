# DOUBLE-EXPONENTIAL-MOVING-AVERAGE-DEMA-AVERAGE-TRUE-RANGE-ATR-updated-V.1.1.2

A Double Exponential Moving Average ( DEMA ) with three sets of channel lines each one Average True Range (ATR) apart, above and below the DEMA .

Similar to my "ATR Channels" indicator, but using a DEMA instead of an EMA for the base. In addition, this indicator also plots a fast DEMA as well as a fill between the two. Fully customizable, you can toggle both DEMAs, the fill, and each set of ATR Channels.

ATR channel idea from Kerry Lovvorn as mentioned in Elder's "New Trading for a Living", page 93: "Kerry Lovvorn likes to plot 3 sets of lines around a moving average: at one, two, and three ATRs above and below an EMA . These can be used for setting up entry points and stops, as well as profit targets."
